## Key Findings

1. **First Finding**
   Across versions 24.10 to 25.3, the "Open ALL RRR Defects" metric for ATLS showed a significant reduction from 149 in version 24.10 to 21 in version 25.2, representing a 71.8% and 50.0% decrease respectively. However, version 25.3 saw a slight increase to 24 defects (+14.3%), indicating stabilization. BTLS followed a similar trend, with a sharp decline from 667 in version 24.10 to 29 in version 25.3 (-45.3%), showcasing effective defect management overall.

2. **Second Finding**
   The "E2E Test Coverage" metric exhibited fluctuating trends, with a peak in version 25.1 at 891 (+17.1%) followed by a sharp decline to 540 (-39.4%) in version 25.2 and further to 328 (-39.3%) in version 25.3. Conversely, "Automation Test Coverage" consistently improved across all versions, rising from 698 in version 24.10 to 959 in version 25.3 (+37.4%), reflecting a strong focus on automation.

3. **Third Finding**
   Security-related observations reveal concerning trends in "Open Security Defects" for ATLS, where defects surged from 4 in version 25.2 to 43 in version 25.3 (+975.0%), indicating a critical risk. BTLS, however, showed improvement, with defects dropping from 94 in version 24.10 to 0 in version 25.3 (-100.0%), demonstrating effective mitigation strategies.

4. **Fourth Finding**
   Testing coverage trends highlight stability in "Unit Test Coverage," maintaining 100% across all versions. However, "E2E Test Coverage" experienced significant volatility, with a notable decline from 891 in version 25.1 to 328 in version 25.3 (-63.2%). This suggests potential gaps in comprehensive end-to-end testing.

5. **Fifth Finding**
   Unexpected patterns emerged in "Customer Specific Testing (UAT)" for Tesco, where the pass rate improved dramatically from 76.7% in version 25.1 to 100.0% in version 25.3 (+23.3%). Similarly, Belk's pass rate rose from 69.8% in version 24.10 to 100.0% in version 25.3 (+43.2%), indicating enhanced testing effectiveness for specific customers.

6. **Sixth Finding**
   Performance metrics for ATLS showed a reduction in "Load/Performance" defects from 5 in version 25.1 to 2 in version 25.3 (-60.0%), signaling improved system stability. BTLS maintained consistent performance, with defects dropping from 11 in version 25.1 to 1 in version 25.3 (-90.9%), further reinforcing reliability.

7. **Seventh Finding**
   Defect management effectiveness improved in version 25.3, as evidenced by the "Defect Closure Rate" increasing from 53.2% in version 25.1 to 60.4% (+7.2%). Regression issues remained stable across versions, with only 2 issues reported consistently, indicating robust regression testing processes.

## Recommendations

1. **Defect Reduction**
   Focus on reducing the number of open RRR defects in the ATLS and BTLS systems, particularly for version 25.3 where the trends show an increase (↑ 14.3% for ATLS and ↓ 45.3% for BTLS). Target a 20% reduction in open defects for the next release cycle by prioritizing high-risk areas and implementing stricter defect resolution timelines.

2. **Security Improvements**
   Address the spike in open security defects for ATLS in version 25.3, which increased by 975%. Implement a dedicated security review process for all new features and aim to reduce open security defects by at least 50% in version 25.4. For BTLS, maintain the current trajectory of zero open security defects in version 25.3 by continuing rigorous testing and patching.

3. **Testing Coverage Enhancements**
   Improve E2E test coverage, which has declined significantly in version 25.3 (↓ 39.3%). Set a goal to increase E2E test cases by 25% in the next release. Additionally, maintain the upward trend in automation test coverage, which has consistently improved, by adding 10% more automated test cases in version 25.4.       

4. **Defect Management Process Changes**
   Enhance the defect closure rate, which has fluctuated across versions. For version 25.3, the closure rate is 60.4% (↓ 7.1%). Introduce stricter SLAs for defect resolution and aim to achieve a closure rate of at least 70% in version 25.4. Additionally, monitor regression issues, which remain constant at 2, to ensure no increase in future releases.

5. **Performance Optimization**
   Address the performance issues in ATLS and BTLS systems, particularly in version 25.1 where the load/performance metrics showed a significant increase (↑ 66.7% for ATLS and ↑ 83.3% for BTLS). Optimize system performance by conducting load testing and targeting a 30% reduction in performance-related issues in version 25.4.

6. **Risk Mitigation Strategies**
   Mitigate risks associated with the increasing trend in all open defects (T-1) for both ATLS and BTLS. For ATLS, defects increased by 7.6% in version 25.3, and for BTLS, defects increased by 1.2%. Implement a risk-based prioritization framework to address high-severity defects first and aim for a 15% reduction in total open defects in the next release.

7. **Monitoring Improvements**
   Enhance monitoring and reporting mechanisms for customer-specific testing (UAT). For example, Tesco's pass rate improved to 100% in version 25.3, but Belk's pass rate fluctuated across versions. Implement real-time dashboards to track UAT pass/fail rates and ensure consistent improvements across all customers. Set a target to maintain a pass rate of 95% or higher for all customers in version 25.4.
