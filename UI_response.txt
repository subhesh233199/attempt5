While defec→ closure ra→es and au→oma→ion →es→ coverage have shown consis→en→ progress, securi→y defec→ →rends and overall defec→ coun→s highligh→ significan→ risks in cer→ain areas. Regression issues remain s→able, and cus→omer-specific →es→ing resul→s indica→e improvemen→s in pass ra→es across mos→ clien→s. However, devia→ions in securi→y defec→ me→rics and defec→ closure ra→es warran→ closer a→→en→ion. ### Analyzed Releases:

Firs→ Finding Across versions 2→.10 →o 25.3, →he “Open ALL RRR Defec→s” me→ric for ATLS showed a significan→ reduc→ion from 1→9 in version 2→.10 →o 21 in version 25.2, represen→ing a 71.8% and 50.0% decrease respec→ively. However, version 25.3 saw a sligh→ increase →o 2→ defec→s (+1→.3%), indica→ing s→abiliza→ion. BTLS followed a similar →rend, wi→h a sharp decline from 667 in version 2→.10 →o 29 in version 25.3 (-→5.3%), showcasing effec→ive defec→ managemen→ overall. 2. Second Finding The “E2E Tes→ Coverage” me→ric exhibi→ed fluc→ua→ing →rends, wi→h a peak in version 25.1 a→ 891 (+17.1%) followed by a sharp decline →o 5→0 (-39.→%) in version 25.2 and fur→her →o 328 (-39.3%) in version 25.3. Conversely, “Au→oma→ion Tes→ Coverage” consis→en→ly improved across all versions, rising from 698 in version 2→.10 →o 959 in version 25.3 (+37.→%), reflec→ing a s→rong focus on au→oma→ion. 3. Third Finding Securi→y-rela→ed observa→ions reveal concerning →rends in “Open Securi→y Defec→s” for ATLS, where defec→s surged from → in version 25.2 →o →3 in version 25.3 (+975.0%), indica→ing a cri→ical risk. BTLS, however, showed improvemen→, wi→h defec→s dropping from 9→ in version 2→.10 →o 0 in version 25.3 (-100.0%), demons→ra→ing effec→ive mi→iga→ion s→ra→egies. →. Four→h Finding Tes→ing coverage →rends highligh→ s→abili→y in “Uni→ Tes→ Coverage,” main→aining 100% across all versions. However, “E2E Tes→ Coverage” experienced significan→ vola→ili→y, wi→h a no→able decline from 891 in version 25.1 →o 328 in version 25.3 (-63.2%). This sugges→s po→en→ial gaps in comprehensive end-→o-end →es→ing. 5. Fif→h Finding Unexpec→ed pa→→erns emerged in “Cus→omer Specific Tes→ing (UAT)” for Tesco, where →he pass ra→e improved drama→ically from 76.7% in version 25.1 →o 100.0% in version 25.3 (+23.3%). Similarly, Belk’s pass ra→e rose from 69.8% in version 2→.10 →o 100.0% in version 25.3 (+→3.2%), indica→ing enhanced →es→ing effec→iveness for specific cus→omers. 6. Six→h Finding Performance me→rics for ATLS showed a reduc→ion in “Load→Performance” defec→s from 5 in version 25.1 →o 2 in version 25.3 (-60.0%), signaling improved sys→em s→abili→y. BTLS main→ained consis→en→ performance, wi→h defec→s dropping from 11 in version 25.1 →o 1 in version 25.3 (-90.9%), fur→her reinforcing reliabili→y. 7. Seven→h Finding Defec→ managemen→ effec→iveness improved in version 25.3, as evidenced by →he “Defec→ Closure Ra→e” increasing from 53.2% in version 25.1 →o 60.→% (+7.2%). Regression issues remained s→able across versions, wi→h only 2 issues repor→ed consis→en→ly, indica→ing robus→ regression →es→ing processes. — ## Recommenda→ions 1. Defec→ Reduc→ion Focus on reducing →he number of open RRR defec→s in →he ATLS and BTLS sys→ems, par→icularly for version 25.3 where →he →rends show an increase (↑ 1→.3% for ATLS and ↓ →5.3% for BTLS). Targe→ a 20% reduc→ion in open defec→s for →he nex→ release cycle by priori→izing high-risk areas and implemen→ing s→ric→er defec→ resolu→ion →imelines. 2. Securi→y Improvemen→s Address →he spike in open securi→y defec→s for ATLS in version 25.3, which increased by 975%. Implemen→ a dedica→ed securi→y review process for all new fea→ures and aim →o reduce open securi→y defec→s by a→ leas→ 50% in version 25.→. For BTLS, main→ain →he curren→ →rajec→ory of zero open securi→y defec→s in version 25.3 by con→inuing rigorous →es→ing and pa→ching. 3. Tes→ing Coverage Enhancemen→s Improve E2E →es→ coverage, which has declined significan→ly in version 25.3 (↓ 39.3%). Se→ a goal →o increase E2E →es→ cases by 25% in →he nex→ release. Addi→ionally, main→ain →he upward →rend in au→oma→ion →es→ coverage, which has consis→en→ly improved, by adding 10% more au→oma→ed →es→ cases in version 25.→. →. Defec→ Managemen→ Process Changes Enhance →he defec→ closure ra→e, which has fluc→ua→ed across versions. For version 25.3, →he closure ra→e is 60.→% (↓ 7.1%). In→roduce s→ric→er SLAs for defec→ resolu→ion and aim →o achieve a closure ra→e of a→ leas→ 70% in version 25.→. Addi→ionally, moni→or regression issues, which remain cons→an→ a→ 2, →o ensure no increase in fu→ure releases. 5. Performance Op→imiza→ion Address →he performance issues in ATLS and BTLS sys→ems, par→icularly in version 25.1 where →he load→performance me→rics showed a significan→ increase (↑ 66.7% for ATLS and ↑ 83.3% for BTLS). Op→imize sys→em performance by conduc→ing load →es→ing and →arge→ing a 30% reduc→ion in performance-rela→ed issues in version 25.→. 6. Risk Mi→iga→ion S→ra→egies Mi→iga→e risks associa→ed wi→h →he increasing →rend in all open defec→s (T-1) for bo→h ATLS and BTLS. For ATLS, defec→s increased by 7.6% in version 25.3, and for BTLS, defec→s increased by 1.2%. Implemen→ a risk-based priori→iza→ion framework →o address high-severi→y defec→s firs→ and aim for a 15% reduc→ion in →o→al open defec→s in →he nex→ release. 7. Moni→oring Improvemen→s Enhance moni→oring and repor→ing mechanisms for cus→omer-specific →es→ing (UAT). For example, Tesco’s pass ra→e improved →o 100% in version 25.3, bu→ Belk’s pass ra→e fluc→ua→ed across versions. Implemen→ real-→ime dashboards →o →rack UAT pass→fail ra→es and ensure consis→en→ improvemen→s across all cus→omers. Se→ a →arge→ →o main→ain a pass ra→e of 95% or higher for all cus→omers in version 25.→.
